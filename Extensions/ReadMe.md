# Extensions

## Dependency

### VC++ Runtime

For Windows, you should install latest [x86 VC++ Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe), aka the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022. Or fusion will not be able to load the extension, like not show in extension list or report error when executing standalone.

Although this runtime is frequently used and almost everyone's computer have this installed, you also should ship this file when you distributing your game/apps, e.g., a installer to auto install it, in case like a refresh installed Windows.

Platforms like Steam has tools to help you achieve this, `App Admin` -> `Edit Steamworks Settings` -> `Installation` -> `Redistributables`, check the check box of `2022 (also includes 2019, 2017 & 2015)` under `Visual C++ Redist`.

Note that you should always install the latest X86 version, as the extension is built with the latest version and utilizes the features introduces in modern C++ standards. Error may not be reported when you trying to load any extension with older version of universal runtime installed, but it may crash when executing the code that involves latest features. So please try updating the runtime when you encounter any crash.

### Fusion

All extensions has build events to auto copy the mfx to fusion install folder, in this repo is copy to the Steam folder: `C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Clickteam Fusion 2.5`

You should change it to your fusion install folder to avoid errors

2. run `git submodule update --init` to init submodule, which will clone boost first
3. cd boost folder
